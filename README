The "Piscine", or swimming pool, is a month-long coding intensive (and by intensive I mean long hours, 7 days per week), used as an entry test into the internationally-recognised "42" coding school. The daily work consists of challenging projects and daily assignments, the skills for which you have to develop yourself, with lots of googling and a willingness to ask for help and input from peers. I.e., no lectures, but instead a learning philosophy that reflects real life, and encourages soft skills as well as technical rigor. This repo is my content from that amazing experience.
